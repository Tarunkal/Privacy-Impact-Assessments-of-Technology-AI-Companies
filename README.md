# Privacy-Impact-Assessments-of-Technology-AI-Companies
Research Project | University of Guelph

Objective


This project analyzes Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), GDPR, and NIST AI policies from leading technology companiesâ€”Microsoft, Google, and IBM. The goal is to evaluate their data protection practices, identify compliance gaps, and assess privacy risks in AI-powered systems. The study focuses on data retention, transparency, data security, and ethical AI use to improve privacy management strategies.

Skills Learned


Conducted comparative analysis of PIAs under GDPR and NIST AI frameworks.
Assessed data life cycle management, from collection to deletion, ensuring regulatory compliance.
Identified privacy risks in AI systems, recommending mitigation strategies.
Gained expertise in analyzing data governance, transparency policies, and AI ethics.
Developed data analysis and documentation skills through structured reports and spreadsheets.


Step-by-Step Methodology


1. Research Design


    Data Collection: Reviewed public privacy policies, GDPR compliance documents, and NIST AI frameworks of Microsoft, Google, and IBM.
    Framework Selection: Applied GDPR, NIST AI, and PIA frameworks to assess privacy practices.


2. Comparative Analysis


    Data Life Cycle Assessment:
    Analyzed data collection, processing, storage, sharing, and deletion practices.
    Evaluated adherence to GDPR principles like data minimization, purpose limitation, and consent management.


    Privacy Impact Assessments:
    Identified privacy risks in AI-driven services.
    Compared how companies manage personal data, third-party sharing, and data retention.


3. Risk Identification & Evaluation
Gap Analysis: Highlighted discrepancies in compliance with GDPR and NIST AI standards.
Risk Mitigation Strategies: Recommended improvements for data protection, privacy governance, and ethical AI deployment.


4. Documentation & Reporting
Created comprehensive tables summarizing findings across companies.
Drafted a detailed report with recommendations for enhancing privacy frameworks.


Tools Used


Frameworks: GDPR, NIST AI, Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
Analysis Tools: Comparative spreadsheets for data tracking and risk identification.
Documentation: Research paper and presentation slides summarizing key findings.


Key Findings


Microsoft, Google, and IBM differ significantly in data retention, privacy governance, and AI ethics.
Identified gaps in third-party data sharing policies and transparency practices.
Highlighted the need for continuous privacy audits and improved data protection mechanisms.
